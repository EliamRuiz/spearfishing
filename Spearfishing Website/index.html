            <p><b>What is it?</b></p>
            <p>    Spearfishing is a method of fishing that involves impaling the fish with a straight pointed object such as a spear, gig or harpoon. It has been deployed in artisanal fishing throughout the world for millennia. Early civilisations were familiar with the custom of spearing fish from rivers and streams using sharpened sticks.

                Modern spearfishing usually involves the use of underwater swimming gear and slingshot-like elastic powered spearguns or compressed gas powered pneumatic spearguns, which launch a tethered underwater projectile to strike the target fish. Specialised techniques and equipment have been developed for various types of aquatic environments and target fish.

                Spearfishing may be done using free-diving, snorkelling or scuba diving techniques, but spearfishing while using scuba equipment is illegal in some countries. The use of mechanically powered spearguns is also outlawed in some countries and jurisdictions such as New Zealand. Spearfishing is highly selective, normally uses no bait and has no by-catch.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Diving without an aqualung is often referred to as ‘skin diving’ or ‘snorkeling’. Both can use a mask, snorkel, and fins, but freediving will always involve a breath-hold, no matter how deep you go. Humans first started freediving through necessity, for food, trade-able items or items lost overboard, however in more recent times, freediving has evolved into a recreational pastime, a way to take photos, catch food, and as a sport.

                                      Competitive freediving has different disciplines to reflect the various ways that you can be in the water and hold your breath.  This came with the emergence of competitions involving teams, countries, and many individuals. Back in the early part of this century, there was a distinction between records done in salt and freshwater, although this has since been stopped.</p>

                <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">License required</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving whereby divers use breathing equipment that is completely independent of a surface air supply.[1] The name "scuba", an acronym for "Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus", was coined by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air,[2] affording them greater independence and movement than surface-supplied divers, and more time underwater than free divers.Although the use of compressed air is common, a gas blend with a higher oxygen content, known as enriched air or nitrox, has become popular due to the reduced nitrogen intake during long and/or repetitive dives.Also, breathing gas diluted with helium may be used to reduce the likelihood and effects of nitrogen narcosis during deeper dives.</p>
